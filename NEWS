Known Bugs
*error when using more than 'n+1' sources with concentration dependence

v.0.3
*updated vignette to include an example analysis.
*added group level estimates to the dietary source contributions plots. these are shown as broken lines.

*fixed error message on 2 source model when no concentration dependence is present.
*added shades of color to observation plots to identify subsources
*added color option to observation plots, also now allows indefinite number of sources on observation plots
*changed observation plots to only include point observations.
*added function to load previously run data and make plots.
*added appropriate colors to the source contribution plots.
