Known Bugs
*error when using more than 'n+1' sources under concentration dependence

v.0.3.1
*fixed mislabeling of diet contribution curves that sometimes occurred
*fixed mixing space x and y axis labels. labels are now read from data file.
*increased the default spacing in mixture error plots so that ellipses will not be outside the axis ranges.
*checked runs under R 2.14.0 and jags 3.1.0


v.0.3
*updated vignette to include an example analysis.
*added group level estimates to the dietary source contributions plots. these are shown as broken lines.
*updated mixing estimate plots to use the density function
*fixed error message on 2 source model when no concentration dependence is present.
*added shades of color to observation plots to identify subsources
*added color option to observation plots, also now allows indefinite number of sources on observation plots
*changed observation plots to only include point observations.
*added function to load previously run data and make plots.
*added appropriate colors to the source contribution plots.


v.0.2.1 
*fixed bug on 2 source plots


v0.2 
4/7/2011
* fixed bug when all text files are included in the model.
* fixed subsource estimation procedure.
* fixed group estimation procedure.
* updated posterior diet contribution plots to include group estimates.
* fixed 2 source mixture and estimation plots.
* cleaned up values of input data passed into run.jags
* cleaned up output variables returned from run.jags
* added vignette
